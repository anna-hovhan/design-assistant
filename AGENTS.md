# Design assistant

Personal tool that generates on-brand visual assets. Each asset type is a generator in `src/generators/<name>/`
that exposes a pure function (same input, same output) and is wired into `src/cli.ts` and a `.claude/commands/<name>.md` command.

- Generators must be deterministic and dependency-free so they can be copied into other projects.
- Text is drawn as SVG paths (never `<text>`) because SVGs used as `<img>` cannot load web fonts.
- Add a test in `src/test/` for every generator. Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before committing.
